<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    This homework centers on the implementation of Bezier curves and surfaces, and various mesh processing operations (area-weighted vertex normal, 
    edge flip, edge split, loop subdivision) for triangle meshes represented using the halfedge data structure. For Bezier curves and surfaces, I 
    implemented de Casteljau's algorithm for the 2D case (curves) and the 3D case (surfaces), which enabled the drawing of Bezier curves and surfaces 
    given a set of control points. The mesh processing operations enabled the altering of the topology of the given triangle meshes. The lighting can 
    be made more smooth using area-weighted vertex normals, and the topology of the mesh can be changed by flipping edges. New triangles and edges can 
    be created using mesh split, and loop subdivision which can produce a smoother and rounder mesh. One thing I learned from this assignment is that 
    a coding style that is systematic but more verbose can be more reliable and easy to think about than one that tries to do the absolute minimum number 
    of operations for the code to function correctly. When implementing Task 4, I ran into a bug as a result of trying to program a more "intuitive" way 
    and fixed my code without issues by following the systematic steps outlined in the spec. I used the same process for Task 5 and 6 and ran into very 
    few issues. Another thing I learned is how preprocessing can be used to get what we want. Instead of blinding performing some operation on a mesh and 
    hoping it gives us what we want, we can preprocess either manually or using an algorithm beforehand to change how that operation affects the mesh.

<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm calculates a point on the Bezier curve given a set of control points and the value of a parameter t 
    between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The algorithm does this by successively calculating intermediate points starting with the control points, 
    where each intermediate point is calculated from the linear interpolation of two of the previous intermediate 
    (or control on the first iteration) points. I implemented evaluating one step of de Castlejau's algorithm by calculating the 
    intermediate points using a lerp inside a loop through all pairs of points, and pushing them to a vector.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    In the 2D case, de Casteljau evaluates a point on a Bezier curve given a set of control points and the value of one parameter t. 
    In the 3D case, de Casteljau evaluates a point on a Bezier surface given a 2D array of control points (in 3D space) and the 
    values of two parameters u and v. To account for the extra dimension, calculating a point on the Bezier surface requires 
    (without loss of generality) first running 1D de Casteljau for each column of control points. Then, we run 1D de Casteljau for 
    the resulting points (treating them as control points) to get the final point on the Bezier surface. My implementation involves 
    2 helper functions evaluateStep and evaluate1D, and a final function evaluate. evaluateStep generates one step of intermediate points 
    along one dimension for a vector of Vector3Ds. evaluate1D uses evaluateStep to evaluate the "final point" along one dimension. Finally, 
    evaluate uses evaluate1D once for every column to get intermediate control points, then one last time on the intermediate control points 
    to get the final point on the Bezier surface.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    I used a while loop through the neighbors of the given vertex. I start adding area-weighted vertex normals from the 2nd neighbor, so 
    I can add one triangle's contribution to the area-weighted vertex normal at a time (I start by using the given vertex, the 1st neighbor, 
    and the 2nd neighbor to form the first triangle). Starting from the 2nd neighbor, I check if the edge from the given vertex to the previous 
    neighbor (the 1st neighbor when the current vertex is the 2nd neighbor) is on the boundary. If it is, then I skip to the next 
    neighbor. If not, then I add the area-weighted normal of the triangle to an accumulated total. Once the loop ends, I use .normalize 
    to normalize the accumulated total to get the final result. The (intermediate) area-weighted normal is calcuated by taking the cross product 
    of two vectors along the triangle (which is equal to 2 * Triangle Area * Normal Vector with norm = 1). The constant factor doesn't matter since 
    everything is normalized at the end.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I implemented the edge flip systematically by putting every halfedge, vertex, edge, and face in the two triangle mesh into a variable,
    and then reassigning the values of each halfedge using setNeighbor and setting the halfedges for all vertices, edges, and faces to 
    a valid halfedge. I drew out an example on paper, giving each mesh element a name in the pre-flip and post-flip two triangle mesh, 
    and assigned values based on the example. What my implementation specifically does is take the edge to be flipped, and uses that edge 
    (in memory) to be the new flipped edge. All other elements stay in the same position except for the two half edges along the edge 
    to be flipped, which are changed to point to their correct elements.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    My first implementation was less systematic and I ran into bugs, which led me to a more systematic implementation like described in the spec. 
    I think the issue I ran into was that I was calling next() on an iterator too many times, and the values I thought I was getting were different 
    from what was actually getting returned by the iterator.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I also implemented the edge split operation very systematically. I assigned all of the elements in a two triangle mesh surrounding the edge 
    to variables. Then, I created just enough new elements (1 vertex, 2 faces, 3 edges, 6 halfedges). Then, I assigned the values of each of the 
    element to their correct value. I drew out an example, labeling all the variables I would use, and how they would be reassigned after the 
    edge gets split. The variables were all pretty arbitrary (except for the halfedges on the exterior of the two triangle mesh), I just used 
    them to create a valid result from splitting. I also made sure to assign the halfedge the new vertex is pointing to to a halfedge that is on 
    the edge of the original edge, for part 6.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I implemented loop subdivision as described in the spec and starter code comments. First I computed new positions for each of the old 
    vertices and set their newPosition equal to them (this was done through a loop over all vertices). Then I computed new positions for 
    each of the new vertices (which will be created later) by iterating through the edges, and using the formula in the spec (and setting 
    the newPosition of the edge). Then I split 
    all of the edges. This was done by looping over all edges, and continuing (skipping the current iteration) if one of the vertices of the 
    edge was new (so I only split edges that connect two old vertices). For split edges, I set isNew to false for the two edges that were 
    part of the original edge, and isNew to true for the two newly created edges. Finally, I flipped all new edges that connected an old 
    and new vertex by iterating through the edges, and then set the position of each vertex to their newPosition by iterating through all 
    of the vertices. By only flipping edges with isNew set to true, we don't flip either of the "new" black edges (since we set the isNew 
    of "new" black edges to false).
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    Meshes become smoother and rounder after loop subdivision. Sharp corners and edges get smoothed and rounded out since the triangles 
    adjacent to the corners/edges are broken up into 4 with positions assigned based on the equations given in the spec. In addition, 
    asymmetric mesh topology can lead to asymmetric geometry after loop subdivision (as in the next question). Pre-splitting some edges to make 
    faces symmetric can help make loop subdivision generate a symmetric geometry. Pre-splitting edges seems to help a little bit with making 
    sharp corners and edges stay a little sharper, but they end up getting pretty smooth after a few levels of loop subdivision even with 
    pre-splitting. A couple images of loop subdivision making the teapot smoother are given below. Some images of sharp corners/edges before 
    and after loop subdivision can be found in the next part (cube.dae).

  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    In the plain cube, each face is represented with 2 triangles and has asymmetric topology (along the vertical and horizontal axes). Because of this, loop subdivision, 
    which subdivides each triangle and sort of "rounds out" each triangle into 4 triangles, results in an asymmetric geometry. The cube can be preprocessed so 
    that this doesn't happen. If we first split each of the diagonal edges on each face of the cube, each face will be symmetrically (along the vertical and 
    horizontal axes) represented by 4 triangles. Because of this, the result of loop subdivisions will also have symmetric geometry. The result of 3 loop subdivisions 
    on a plain cube and on a cube with preprocessing (with edge splitting) are documented below.
